About:
The assignment is a game in which the player has to go from his current position to a destination, while avoiding obstacles. The world consists 
of tiles surrounded by water. Some tiles are missing, some are moving in horizontal/vertical motion, some are fire tiles/teleporter (if the      player walks on any of these tiles, then he is transported back to his starting position).
During this journey, his actions could be viewed from multiple positions, which is controllable from the keyboard keys.
Player can collect coins and gets three lives if he accidentally falls in the pits.
