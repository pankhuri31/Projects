- ROLL NUMBER :: 201101174

* CODE ORGANISATION
  I used 5 modules in my code.

** Modules used

- put :: to insert bomb and defuse codes randomly on the window
- moveRobot :: to move the robot using the arrow keys which are given as input by the user
- escapeKey :: to exit the game whenever user presses escape key
- enemy :: to insert an enemy mine that kills the robot
- displayScore :: displays the score when the user wins or looses the game

* CLASS DECOMPOSITION
  My code has one empty class.

* ADVANTAGES
- My class takes size of the window(F1 x F2),number of defuse codes(d),size of the robot(r x r) 
  and count of the defusecodes collected by the user(count) which when multiplyed by 10 gives
  the score at a level.
- The varibles can be modified easily in the class and are accessible throughout
  the code. Thus user can change size of the robot, screen size and can make the game look
  different.
* MISCELLANEOUS
- deleting the previous coordinates of the robot in the window.
- inserting the robot at the new coordinates as per the movement of the arrow keys
- exits the game if the robot hits the borders, enemy or the bomb(without collecting the 
 required number of defuse codes)
- psitions of the bimb, defuse codes and the enemy are randomly generated within the window
- if 'p' or 'P' is pressed then the game pauses and is resumed when toggled and exits when 'escape key' is pressed
 
* EXTRA FEATURES
- the game has two levels
- there is an enemy mine in the second level which kills the robot
- colours are used to increase the appeal of the game
- after level one is completed, user gets a choice to play the next level or to quit
- user can play the next level even without clearing the previous one
